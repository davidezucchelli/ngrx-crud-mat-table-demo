##  Angular NGRX CRUD Demo with Material Table

A simple CRUD application created in Angular and NGRX.
This is a starter project which uses NGRX stores and effects to perform CRUD operations. 
It's a perfect place to demonstrate how NGRX works and how to handle:

* store `forRoot` and `forFeatures` 
* actions
* reducers 
* effects
* selectors

## USAGE

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
